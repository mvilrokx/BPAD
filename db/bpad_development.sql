In Fusion, the attributes available for compiling a time category will be time attribute fields or other time categories. <p>\n                   <p>The time category definition requires the flexibility for a user to add as many conditions as they need to summarize time attributes.  It is also required to group these conditions into logical expressions, with comparisons between these expressions.  In order to offer this flexibility, we will use the Fusion Structured Condition Builder Guideline.  Reference to this Guideline: http://fusiongps.us.oracle.com/guidelines/content/guidelines/expressionbuilder/conditions/index.htm#StructuredCondition.

For example, a timecard period may have aduration of biweekly, but an approval period defined for payroll might be weekly.  The ability for different time consumers to define different approval periods for the timecards to be retrieved allows for the time to be transferred on a timely basis to the time consumer.  Approval periods will be setup in the time consumer set UI, associated to each time consumer who will be retrieving the worker’s timecard data.\n\nApproval periods can span across timecards.  For example, an approval period for Payroll might be weekly, which could start on one timecard and complete on the next timecard.  In this example, when the 2nd timecard has reached the approval period upon submit, the time from the prior timecard needs to be consolidated with the time from the 2nd timecard and routed for approval.  In this example, it is important to note that the submission of the first timecard would not trigger approval, it was upon the submitting of the 2nd timecard that it needed to be determined if the overlapping approval period was met.\n\nSome examples of when timecard periods and approval periods are not aligned:\n\nIn some cases customers want to have a short Timecard Period and a long Approval Period. This is because the customer wants to force users to submit time on a frequent basis yet not burden their approvers with frequent approvals.  \nFor example: Daily Timecard Period and Weekly Approval Period   \n\nIn some cases customers (eg Santos) want to have a short approval period and a longer timecard period. This is because the customer wants to move the time that’s been entered through to the time consumer as quickly as possible. For example, a weekly timecard period and a daily approval period. Users submit there timecard whenever they enter time and this time is then sent to the approver and can be transferred to the time consumer without waiting till the end of the week.\n\nIn the case where there is more than one time consumer for a given worker\'s time, it may be that 2 or more of the Time Consumers have their own, \'natural\' approval period. For example Projects might have a Weekly Expenditure Period and Payroll a Bi-monthly payroll period. In this case, at least one of the approval periods must differ from the Timecard Period.','2011-04-13 22:38:22','2011-04-13 22:38:22',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1247,127,'Approval Rules (AMX)','In order to correctly route the timecard data to approvers, there are evaluations of the timecard that need to be done which would continue the same functionality as Approval Styles and Approval Rules in EBS Time and Labor R12.  Firstly, it needs to be determined if approval is needed on timecard submission, based on the approval period defined for the timecard.  Then if approval is required, it needs to be determined, what type of approval needs to be done, such as auto-approval or routing to one or more approvers.    The approval rules defined in AMX will determine what timecard data is collected for approval and to whom it is routed for approval, and how the routings will occur.\n\nThe approvers may or not be in the same application (i.e. Payroll, Projects).  Once the type of approval is determined, it needs to be determined what timecard data needs to be packaged and transferred to the approvers, based on rule criteria, which can include the summing of data using time categories.  Time categories allow for the summing up of time against different time entry fields present on the timecard.  These time categories can sum up data that is specific to an application, like Payroll or Projects, or it can simply sum up a specific group of time entries, such as overtime or bonuses which require approval.\n\nThe approval rules made available in AMX need to provide the following flexibility:\n\no     Need the ability to define approval rules by role , to allow time to be approved by role (project manager(derived by Project ID) , payroll manager, timekeeper, manager).\n\n \n\no     Need the ability to define approval rules based on data values in the timecard ( assignment status (based on Core HR status) , summarization, timecard status, project manager, overtime, hours exceeding “X” hours, Project ID exists, Hours Type of “Overtime, Special Compensation”.

It is important that a user can combine any attributes which are associated to a worker in HCM as well as time attributes, which can be defined and combined with time categories.  Time categories can also be used in “exceed limits” rules.

Some workers may only require auto approval of time, whereas other groups of workers may require different types of time to be approved.  Being able to associate different levels of timecard approval requirements to different workers provides more efficiency for overall approval processing.\n\nTo accomplish this goal, different Approval Transaction Types will be defined in AMX, with groupings of Approval Rules.  These Approval Transaction Types will be associated to the time consumer in the Time Consumer Set UI.  The worker will be associated to the Approval Transaction Type based on the Time Consumer Set assigned to his Time and Labor Worker Processing Setup Profile.

There should be a mechanism in which the user can configure imported time to be “stamped” with an approved status.  In this manner, the time should not be routed through any approval process, it should just be approved and ready to be transferred to another application. \n\nHowever, any time which is loaded into Time and Labor will be processed through application validations (validations of the time consumers which will retrieve the time).   If any time that is validated is in error, then it cannot be stamped as approved.  The timecard errors will need to be resolved before they can be “stamped” as approved.  The Approval Transaction Type option of “Auto-Approve” defined in Section 2.3.29 can be utilized for this scenario, when the errors are cleared and the timecards are resubmitted.','2011-04-13 22:38:22','2011-04-13 22:38:22',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1251,127,'Forced Approval  (AMX)','For timecards which are not slated for auto approval, but need to be routed to approvers, there are times that the timecards may need to be forced through approvals.  There may be a timing issue in which the timecards need to get processed to payroll immediately, or there may be a breakdown in the approval routing in which approvers are not available.  There needs to be a process in which a user can easily determine the timecards which are pending approval and be able to approve them.  The ability to do this approval may require special “override approval” security.\n\nExample of the terminated worker scenario:\n\nIn the event that a worker is terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily), there needs to be a way to move the timecard through the approval process to get the accurate recorded time to payroll for payment.  At issue is that the approval period may not be met even if the timecard is submitted, so would not automatically route to the AMX routing rules.\n\nA worker submits a timecard which only contains 2 days of a weekly Payroll approval period. The worker is terminated and therefore will not be submitting the next timecard which would \'fill up\' the Time Approval Transaction. There are two days which need to be paid but the timecard submission would not complete the approval period to trigger AMX approvals.\n\nThere is an enhancement request for AMX to provide and API for Forced Approval, which is not available as of yet - Enhancement 7495226.  To utilize this API we would need to specify parameters of when to call this API and for which worker’s timecards.  As this API is not currently available, the main design solution for Fusion v2 is the following:\n\nIn Fusion v2, in order to expedite timecards being pushed to a time consumer, we will not force the approval but we will leave the approval process as it is, but we will force the timecards for immediate transfer. Using the Group Time Entry user interface, the administrator can select workers and their related timecards which need to be immediately transferred.  We are calling this process “Forced Transfer”.  Going forward with this solution, that will permit the timecard to carry on its normal approval route and hence allows the approver to reject the timecards if wrong/missing entries were made. If the timecard gets rejected, after getting transfered in a time consumer application, after the timecard gets corrected and approved, in the next transfer to the time consumer adjustement will be made.\n\nAn alternate solution for terminated workers is that we can subscribe to event triggers such as terminations of employees, which would trigger the adjustment of approval periods to end on the employee’s termination date, to expedite the approval of the required timecards.','2011-04-13 22:38:22','2011-04-13 22:38:22',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1252,127,'Approval of Blank Timecards (AMX)','For businesses which always require timecards to be generated and approved for all time periods for their employees, it is important that even a blank timecard can be approved.

In this instance, the timecard will be waiting for the next timecard to be submitted to see if the approval period has been met for it also to be routed for approval.  As a result, this timecard is in a “holding pattern” until the approval period is met.

A set of  related values may be entered often by the user, so it would be helpful to allow the user to string them together with a shortcut or combination code.  For the business, there may be a set of related attribute values which are valid for the worker’s entry.  In this scenario, the administrator could setup a list of the related attribute values which are relevant for the user and associate them to a shortcut or combination code. This scenario is often true for customers with Project Portfolio Management, who have multiple Project Attributes which are related to each other.  In either scenario, the combination codes which are created have to be unique to the set of attribute values to which they are associated to.  There also has to be a way of refreshing the list of combination codes, as the related values may no longer be valid, as they may have been closed or inactivated.   Additionally, the related attributes may be display only or may be editable by the user.   Below are a few different design options for allowing for the creation of the combination or shortcut code.\r\n\r\no	Combination Code Self-Entry on Template – Add an optional field on the Public and Private Templates within the timecard matrix, to let the user enter a short code that would label the set of attributes they are entering on that line.  Then that code can be used later by the user in timecard entry.\r\n\r\no	Combination Code Self-Entry on Timecard – Add an optional field for “combination code” to the left of the time attributes in the timecard matrix, so the user can enter a code for that set of attributes and then use it later.   In future use of the “combination code” field, all the values that the user entered would be available for his entry.  Once he selected a combination code, the other related time attributes would automatically be populated.  There would need to be some business rules set in place for the saved combination codes, that they were unique, for the set of values being entered.\r\n\r\no	Dynamic Alternate Name Set – Enhance the Alternate Name Set so that an administrator can enter a simple code when setting up the Alternate Name values, which can be associated to a set of time attribute values, which can be displayed or not displayed on the timecard matrix.  In the Timecard, the Combination Code can be displayed as the “editable” field for entry, using the alternate name set as the choice list, and the related fields would be displayed or not, as per the setup of the Alternate Name.\r\nThere may be a long list of related values which require combination codes to be associated to them.  In this case, there might need to be a batch process to auto-generate unique combination codes for a long list of combinations of values.  There will also need to be a validation process to ensure each value in the combinations is still valid for use.  \r\n\r\no	Most Frequently Used – Allow for user configuration of time attributes to link together to reference for “most frequently used” values.  The display of these values can be auto-generated by the system based on previous usage.  This combination of values can be accessed by the user to apply to new rows of data.\r\n\r\no	“My Favorites” Values – Allow for user configuration of time attributes to link together for reference for favorites.

Options would include notification to worker, to timekeeper or manager.  The notification would need to communicate to the recipient if the timecard was modified, including  the fields of  “Last Modified By” and “Date of Action”.  Development would need to seed a worklist notification to display for a modified timecard.  Would be beneficial if it can be defined what changes had occurred in the timecard.  If this is not possible, there should be a link to the timecard to view the modified timecard.\r\n\r\n4.

There are many reasons why adjustments to the timecard are needed.  It can be that the original time was entered incorrectly, either because time was entered in advance and the actual hours changed or because the hours were booked to the wrong project/tasks or wrong departments.  Additionally, time may have been entered as paid leave to which the employee was not entitled, and the time has to be rebooked as unpaid leave.  \r\n\r\nPayroll Managers may need to go back and ensure adjustments are made to time, in order for time to be paid correctly in payroll.  Project Managers or Project Accountants may need to go back and make changes to time, to rebook hours to different combinations of Projects and Tasks or change work time to sick or vacation time, or visa versa.  These adjustments are required for proper billing to customers and correct updates to project plans.\r\n\r\nIn order for Payroll Managers, Project Managers and Project Accountants to make the adjustments to time, the best approach is for them to have access to change time at the source, reported time in the Timecard Entry page.  For that reason, based on role assignment of “timekeeper”, they can be given access to our Group Time Entry feature to make these adjustments.  The access to the workers who require adjustments can be derived from defined group criteria.  The display of the needed fields will be determined via delivered Layout sets with Payroll and Projects.    See Group Time Entry FDD for more details on access to employees via Groups and time entry functionality by worker or batch views, as well as mass time entry updates.\r\n\r\nAs the flow of these time adjustments may have a hard deadline because of a payroll to be processed or a billing cycle which needs to be closed in Projects, expedited processing is needed.  An attribute could be stored within the timecard to be populated when an adjustment is occurring (upon submit of the adjusted timecard).  If this attribute is populated, then as the timecard enters the AMX Approval flow, this attribute can trigger an auto-approval rule which automatically approves the timecard.  At that point, the timecard will be immediately available for the transfer services to deposit it into the interface tables for immediate retrieval by Payroll and Projects.\r\n      ','2011-04-13 22:38:24','2011-05-03 23:05:11',1,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1372,143,'Adjustments to Processed Time - jf','Must Have Justification :  Allow for Exception Measures to Correct Time for Immediate Transfer of Time  \r\n\r\nProcessed Time is the net result of time calculation rules being applied to raw time in a timecard.  Normally, processed time should only be updated by the running of these rules in an online or batch process.  \r\n\r\nThere is the situation in which the rule results in processed time were not what was expected.  If the user (timekeeper or administrator) does not have adequate time to change the rules setup , or using override rules on the timecard would not resolve the time correctly, then the user should be able to make adjustments to the actual processed time.  The security for the duty of updating processed time should be very controlled as this is not a normal method of processing time.\r\n\r\nThe timekeeper or administrator who is granted access to adjust calculated time, would  be given access to our Group Time Entry feature to make these adjustments.  The access to the workers who require adjustments can be derived from defined group criteria.  The individual timecard view will display a section for Processed Time results.  Based on security and layout set, the administrator will be able to have edit access to this section.  Once the administrator makes his changes and saves or submits the timecard, there will be a message associated with the Process Time Section that “Processed Time has been adjusted”.  See Group Time Entry FDD for more details on access to employees via Groups and time entry functionality by worker or batch views, as well as mass time entry updates.\r\n\r\nAs with adjustments to raw time, there may be a hard deadline because of a payroll to be processed or a billing cycle which needs to be closed in Projects.  This should invoke the  expedited processing  for the adjusted timecard.  If this is necessary, the administrator can select timecards which are required to be “forced transfer” to time consumers by a separate “forced transfer” action.   The timecards will still be routed through the normal approval flow in AMX, but will be immediately available to be retrieved by time consumers once they are marked as “Forced Transfer”.\r\n\r\nIn the future, if there need to be any updates to the raw time of the timecard, we should allow the updates to occur.  After the timecard is submitted, a workflow notification “Review changes to adjusted timecard” should be triggered and sent to the administrator.  This notification will contain the adjustments made to the processed time on the last version of the timecard.  The administrator will need to determine if he needs to reapply adjustments to processed time to the timecard.  Once he is complete, he will submit the timecard, and the timecard will be routed via the AMX approval flow.\r\n\r\nThe adjustments to processed time need to be tracked from an audit perspective, just as changed to raw time would.  We need to know the person, role, date/time and updates made to the timecard.\r\n\r\nThe complete flow of dealing with adjustments to raw or processed time will be covered in a new FDD, Time and Labor Validations and Adjustments FDD.\r\n','2011-04-13 22:38:24','2011-05-03 23:05:57',1,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1373,143,' Validating Time - jf','Must Have Justification :  Support Existing Validation Process of EBS Time and Labor R12 with enhancements for Fusion    \r\n\r\nValidations of time will be applied as the user moves through the timecard process, specific to validations delivered by Payroll or Project sections.

Validations on raw time is validating what the user actually enters on their timecard entry page.  The validations on processed time is validating the results of applying time calculation rules. The validations on processed time is new for Fusion.   The reason for validating processed time is that is what the time consumers, Payroll and Projects (PPM) will receive and validate as they receive it. Validating the time at the point of entry will save time later from having transfer errors because the timecard could not be accepted by the time consumer.  \r\n\r\nErrors which are generated from validations will be displayed to the user in an error message listing pop-up on the Timecard Entry page.

Contextual Area Option\r\nOpen Calendar Navigation\r\n \r\nThe idea is to always have an opened calendar display for the user, to highlight the current timecard period which is currently displayed, and be allowed to select the next or previous timecard period by clicking on any date in the calendar month displayed.  \r\nOnce the new date is clicked on, the related timecard period will be highlighted and the local display of that timecard period would either be refreshed to reflect those dates, or a new tab would open for that new timecard period.  This is helpful if the user wants to compare entries from one timecard to another. – Open Design Issue\r\n\r\nIdeally, this display would appear in the Regional section of the timecard, as other navigational tools appear.  Currently, there are constraints on needing it to appear in the Contextual section of the page due to navigational flows and ability to control the calendar display by application specific code.  \r\n\r\nDesign Note:  This use of the Calendar widget requires enhancements from ADF on this component to support the highlighting of a time period based on a selected date.

At this point we are not offering a switcher for less than a 	week.  \r\n	Prior to Fusion, the timecard user would have a horizontal scroll to navigate through the timecard 	days.  The 	following are two options the user can choose from in the Time Entry Page Composer.  \r\n	The display of a timecard period will always start with the start date of the timecard instance.\r\n	A.  Weekly Selector\r\n	Allows for a user to easily navigate from one week to another for timecard periods which exceed one week.  This option 	would allow the user to not have to scroll horizontally through weeks, but be able to click an arrow to the next week or 	prior week within the timecard.  This would be most beneficial for bi-weekly timecard users.  \r\nFor semi-monthly or monthly timecard periods, there may be  days not applicable at the end of the week which are not part of the current period, which would be grayed out.  There would be a week selector above the timecard matrix for the user to navigate back and forth between the weeks within the timecard period.  The day/date columns would just change in the user’s view.  The other attributes would remain in display, as if the columns were frozen before the day/date fields.  The column and row totals would need to reflect only the totals of the days displayed to the user.  As a result, the attributes from one week would display on the other weeks, since only the days are being scrolled to the right.\r\n	Weekly Selector prototype:\r\n \r\nOpen Design Issue:  An issue with this design is the error messaging reference to the correct location of the error.  If the user is accessing the error message listing pop-up (listed above in Must Have Section 2.3.1), and clicks on the error message, the cursor should take the user to where the error exists in the timecard matrix.  With the intra-period navigation, not all entries are visible at once, so this functionality would not work.  A recommendation from UX is that when the user is accessing errors from the error message listing pop-up the intra-period navigation is hidden and the user will get the normal horizontal scroll through the days.\r\nB.  Horizontal Scroll with Column Grouping by Week\r\nThis design is an alternate design option to allow for horizontal scroll through the timecard period.  Both options will be available in the timecard layout set creation. The attributes would not scroll, only the days of the week.  As the user clicked on a hyperlink for Week 1, Week 2, etc, the matrix would advance to that week, by displaying the first day of the week within the view of days.  There would not need to be an “overflow” icon, as we would not exceed the display of 4 weeks in a timecard.\r\n','2011-04-13 22:38:24','2011-05-03 23:10:33',1,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1376,150,'Timecard Period Security Access - jf','Must Have Justification:    Support Existing EBS Time and Labor R12 Status Allowing Edit functionality 	with Enhancements\r\n\r\nProvide ability to restrict access to timecards for prior or future time, by timecard actions,  for workers, managers or timekeepers.

This can be a simple button on the Time Keeper entry form that will start the TCR calculation on-line and shows them the results in a separate window (one timecard with rule results at a time)  ','2011-04-13 22:38:24','2011-04-13 22:38:24',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1417,137,'Multiple Assignment Support','As with other requirements, this will be taken into consideration at design time (i.e. TCR will be multiple assignment aware), but no special effort will be put into actually providing features for multiple assignments.

Note that the SOA uptake might change what we send to recipient applications but that has nothing to do with this feature, at least this feature will most likely not cause such a change.

Either way, this will provide them with the flexibility to control any attribute on the resulting calculated time entries.\n\nAlso, because we are allowing calculations on all kinds of time, meaning for all kinds of attributes, it becomes very hard for us in development to know exactly what needs to be the result of a rule, in fact it is impossible to know and most likely it is different for different customers, so opening this up for our customers is necessary and unavoidable.','2011-04-13 22:38:25','2011-04-13 22:38:25',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1445,140,'Time Balances','Some time business rules require time to be aggregated over a period of time.  Just like we do not know what kind of business rules customers want to apply to their time, we generally do not know how they want to aggregate time.  Not only do we not know the period but we also do not know what kind of time they want to group.  Depending on the attribution time might be in our out of the balance.  Therefore, we need to let our users setup their own Time Balances and we will leverage Payroll Balances to accomplish this.  This introduces a dependency on Core Payroll to ensure that Payroll Balances work with Time (instead of pay values).  Because we are able to use Payroll Balances, this feature requires no coding.  However, we need to seed the basic components of a balance (Balance Types and Balance Dimensions) so our users can create balances in the first place.','2011-04-13 22:38:25','2011-04-13 22:38:25',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1446,140,'Rule Assignment','Once the rules have been created, they need to somehow be “assigned” to people so that those rules get applied to those employees’ timecards.

Sometimes it is necessary for a rule to interpret a day slightly different and a day would go from say 22:00 to 21:59:59 the next day, overlapping 2 real days.  As rules are sometimes dependant on a day, it is important that we let our customers decide when these “work days” start and end so their rules apply as they see fit.  A typical example is a premium that depends on a day, say Sunday.  If the shift starts on a that day – Sunday 22:00 – but runs into the next day – Monday 06:00 – then they employee might be entitled to the Sunday Premium the whole shift, even though he only really worked 2 hours on Sunday, and the rest on Monday.  Or he might not be.  This is entirely up to the customer and as a result we need to let them decide when a day starts or stops in relation to a Rule.','2011-04-13 22:38:25','2011-04-13 22:38:25',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1448,140,'Ability to use HR Holiday Calendar in TCR','This feature will allow TCR to become “holiday aware”.  This awareness can then be used in rules or to determine which rules need to be used depending on the Holiday.  This feature will rely heavily on the HR Calendar module that stores the corporate Holiday Calendar.  In TCR, you will then be able to link Rules to this calendar and as a result get different rules on those Holiday Days.','2011-04-13 22:38:25','2011-04-13 22:38:25',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1449,140,'Time Calculation Templates','TCR Templates are probably the feature that will make or break TCR.  Because the TCR module allows for so much flexibility, creating even the simplest of rules could become a pretty daunting task.  We need to try to avoid this at all costs and this is where templates will come in.  Therefore, for certain rules (and we still need to determine which ones) we will provide “rule templates”.  These rule templates will consists of a Fast Formula Template, and a form which can be used to answer a few questions that are needed to transform the template into a real Fast Formula.  Behind the scenes it will also create the Rule Results (again based on answers from the user), the processing rule (when the Fast Formula needs to fire), potentially a new balance and anything else that is necessary for it to become a rule that can be used in a Time Calculation Rule Set.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, we know that we cannot create formulas for all possible scenarios and so we also need to expose forms that our customers can use to create rules from scratch.  This would mean a form to create Fast Formulas (re-using the Payroll / HR Fast Formula Form), Rule Template (defining inputs and outputs then shown on the Rule Page)TCR Rules, TCR Rule Results and Balances.  T&L will make the Template page a mandatory step in defining new rules, placed over the formula, and making the actual rule creation a bit more functional.','2011-04-13 22:38:25','2011-04-13 22:38:25',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1450,140,'Tags','Littered throughout the requirement document, there are references to a so called “Rule Type”.  The purpose of this type was that we might be able to classify rules into these types and make it easier for our users to find a particular rule using the Rule Type.  This Rule Type however is probably too restrictive.  We will not be able to stripe our data by Business Group anymore, nor by Legislation (this is a functional decision; rules are to be global), so this type should also replace that functionality.  Finally, some rules cannot be easily classified and users can create their own rules for which we would have no type handy.  All this means that we need more flexible way to classify rules so that customers can find the rules they need.\n\nWe opted for a tagging (aka labeling) mechanism.  This allows our customers to add as many tags as the want to their rules that will make it easy for them to find them back later on.  E.g. a threshold rule could have the following tags: us overtime 8.  These 3 tags would indicate that the actual threshold rule is a rule that applies to the US, calculates Overtime, and has a threshold of 8.  Whenever the users need to search for a Rule, they can supply any combination of tags and a list of rules matching those tags will appear.  For example, they might want to see all rules that have “us” as a tag (presumably these are rules applicable to the US legislation, but the point is that it could really mean anything the customer wants it to be).\n\nThe tagging infrastructure will also be made available for other entities in HXC, and we might use it as well for TCR fast Formulas.','2011-04-13 22:38:25','2011-04-13 22:38:25',NULL,'Should Have','2.0',NULL),(1451,141,'No Name','  ','2011-04-13 22:38:25','2011-04-13 22:38:25',NULL,'Must Have','2.0',NULL),(1457,144,'Messaging - Tip of the Day - jf','Tip of the Day – a message type that is offered by some users, which can have different messages displayed to the timecard user on dynamic basis.

These categories are used to trigger validations and rules on time entries, for summary timecard analytics, or for balances used in rules.   A time category itself can be a nested time category of other time categories.   In Fusion, the attributes available for compiling a time category will be time attribute fields or other time categories. <p>\\n                   <p>The time category definition requires the flexibility for a user to add as many conditions as they need to summarize time attributes.  It is also required to group these conditions into logical expressions, with comparisons between these expressions.  In order to offer this flexibility, we will use the Fusion Structured Condition Builder Guideline.  Reference to this Guideline: http://fusiongps.us.oracle.com/guidelines/content/guidelines/expressionbuilder/conditions/index.htm#StructuredCondition. Using this structured condition builder design approach will make it easier for users to uptake the feature, as they will have exposure to this design in other applications, such as AMX approval rules setup.<p>\\n                   <p>Create Time Category page</p>\\n\\n\\\n  <p>Create Time Category : Page Name</p>\\n\\n\\\n  <p>Tags: enable the web center icon to allow user to define tags on time categories</p>\\n\\n         <p>Summary Information:</p>\\n\\\n  <p>\\n   <li> Name: Time Category Name</li>\\n\\n <li>   Description: Time Category Description</li>\\n\\\n  </p>\\n    <p>     Time Category Condition Pane</p>\\n\\n    <p> Actions Menu</p>\\n    <p>\\n          <li> Add</li>\\n          <li> Duplicate</li>\\n            \\n          <li>Delete</li>\\n            \\n          <li>Add Nest</li>\\n          <li> Delete Nest </li>\\n\\\n  </p>\\n\\\n  <p>Actions Behavior</p>\\n\\\n  <p>\\n\\\n  <li>  Add New Row (No Selection): A new row is inserted after the last row in the table.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li>    Add New Row (Row Selected): A new row is added below the selected row.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li> Add New Row (Multiple Rows Selected): One new row is added below the last selected row.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li>    Duplicate Row: The duplicate row is added below the selected row.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li> Duplicate Multiple Rows: The group of duplicated rows is added below the selected group.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li>    Duplicate Noncontiguous Duplication: The group of duplicated rows is added below the selected row or group of rows.\\n\\\n  Example: If the user selects rows 2, 3, and 5, and then clicks the Duplicate icon, the duplicated rows appear below the 2 and 3 grouping and below row 5. \\n\\\n  </li>\\n\\\n  <li>    Delete Row: Deletes the selected row from the table.

Some workers may only require auto approval of time, whereas other groups of workers may require different types of time to be approved.  Being able to associate different levels of timecard approval requirements to different workers provides more efficiency for overall approval processing.\\n\\n\\\n  To accomplish this goal, different Approval Transaction Types will be defined in AMX, with groupings of Approval Rules.  These Approval Transaction Types will be associated to the time consumer in the Time Consumer Set UI.  The worker will be associated to the Approval Transaction Type based on the Time Consumer Set assigned to his Time and Labor Worker Processing Setup Profile.  The options for the Approval Transaction Type choicelist will either be \\xE2\\x80\\x9CAuto-Approval\\xE2\\x80\\x9D, which will bypass the AMX flow, or one of the seeded Approval Transaction Types in AMX.\"\niteration_id: \n','2011-04-13 22:36:54'),(2696,'Feature',782,'destroy','1','--- \nscope: \nname: Auto Approval of Loaded Time and Labor)\ncreated_at: 2011-04-13 22:03:49 Z\nupdated_at: 2011-04-13 22:03:49 Z\npriority: \nid: 782\nfunctional_work_unit_id: 93\ndescription: \"Time can be loaded into Time and Labor from an API from any time collection system.

In this manner, the time should not be routed through any approval process, it should just be approved and ready to be transferred to another application. \\n\\n\\\n  However, any time which is loaded into Time and Labor will be processed through application validations (validations of the time consumers which will retrieve the time).   If any time that is validated is in error, then it cannot be stamped as approved.  The timecard errors will need to be resolved before they can be \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cstamped\\xE2\\x80\\x9D as approved.

There may be a timing issue in which the timecards need to get processed to payroll immediately, or there may be a breakdown in the approval routing in which approvers are not available.  There needs to be a process in which a user can easily determine the timecards which are pending approval and be able to approve them.  The ability to do this approval may require special \\xE2\\x80\\x9Coverride approval\\xE2\\x80\\x9D security.\\n\\n\\\n  Example of the terminated worker scenario:\\n\\n\\\n  In the event that a worker is terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily), there needs to be a way to move the timecard through the approval process to get the accurate recorded time to payroll for payment.  At issue is that the approval period may not be met even if the timecard is submitted, so would not automatically route to the AMX routing rules.\\n\\n\\\n  A worker submits a timecard which only contains 2 days of a weekly Payroll approval period. The worker is terminated and therefore will not be submitting the next timecard which would \'fill up\' the Time Approval Transaction. There are two days which need to be paid but the timecard submission would not complete the approval period to trigger AMX approvals.\\n\\n\\\n  There is an enhancement request for AMX to provide and API for Forced Approval, which is not available as of yet - Enhancement 7495226.  To utilize this API we would need to specify parameters of when to call this API and for which worker\\xE2\\x80\\x99s timecards.  As this API is not currently available, the main design solution for Fusion v2 is the following:\\n\\n\\\n  In Fusion v2, in order to expedite timecards being pushed to a time consumer, we will not force the approval but we will leave the approval process as it is, but we will force the timecards for immediate transfer. Using the Group Time Entry user interface, the administrator can select workers and their related timecards which need to be immediately transferred.  We are calling this process \\xE2\\x80\\x9CForced Transfer\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.  Going forward with this solution, that will permit the timecard to carry on its normal approval route and hence allows the approver to reject the timecards if wrong/missing entries were made. If the timecard gets rejected, after getting transfered in a time consumer application, after the timecard gets corrected and approved, in the next transfer to the time consumer adjustement will be made.\\n\\n\\\n  An alternate solution for terminated workers is that we can subscribe to event triggers such as terminations of employees, which would trigger the adjustment of approval periods to end on the employee\\xE2\\x80\\x99s termination date, to expedite the approval of the required timecards.\"\niteration_id: \n','2011-04-13 22:36:54'),(2698,'Feature',784,'destroy','1','--- \nscope: \nname: Approval of Blank Timecards (AMX)\ncreated_at: 2011-04-13 22:03:49 Z\nupdated_at: 2011-04-13 22:03:49 Z\npriority: \nid: 784\nfunctional_work_unit_id: 93\ndescription: \"For businesses which always require timecards to be generated and approved for all time periods for their employees, it is important that even a blank timecard can be approved.

In future use of the \\\"combination code\\\"\\n field, all the values that the user entered would be available for\\n his entry.  Once he selected a combination code, the other related\\n time attributes would automatically be populated.  There would need\\n to be some business rules set in place for the saved combination\\n codes, that they were unique, for the set of values being entered.\\n\\\n  o\\tDynamic Alternate Name Set - Enhance the Alternate Name Set so that\\n an administrator can enter a simple code when setting up the Alternate\\n Name values, which can be associated to a set of time attribute values,\\n which can be displayed or not displayed on the timecard matrix. \\n In the Timecard, the Combination Code can be displayed as the \\\"editable\\\"\\n field for entry, using the alternate name set as the choice list,\\n and the related fields would be displayed or not, as per the setup\\n of the Alternate Name.\\n\\\n  There may be a long list of related values which require combination\\n codes to be associated to them.  In this case, there might need to\\n be a batch process to auto-generate unique combination codes for\\n a long list of combinations of values.  There will also need to be\\n a validation process to ensure each value in the combinations is\\n still valid for use.  \\n\\\n  o\\tMost Frequently Used - Allow for user configuration of time attributes\\n to link together to reference for \\\"most frequently used\\\" values.\\n  The display of these values can be auto-generated by the system\\n based on previous usage.  This combination of values can be accessed\\n by the user to apply to new rows of data.\\n\\\n  o\\t\\\"My Favorites\\\" - Values - Allow for user configuration of time attributes\\n to link together for reference for favorites.

Weekly Selector\\n\\n\\\n  Allows for a user to easily navigate from one week to another for\\n timecard periods which exceed one week.  This option  would allow\\n the user to not have to scroll horizontally through weeks, but be\\n able to click an arrow to the next week or  prior week within the\\n timecard.  This would be most beneficial for bi-weekly timecard users.\\n\\n\\\n  For semi-monthly or monthly timecard periods, there may be days not\\n applicable at the end of the week which are not part of the current\\n period, which would be grayed out.

A recommendation from UX is that\\n when the user is accessing errors from the error message listing\\n pop-up the intra-period navigation is hidden and the user will get\\n the normal horizontal scroll through the days.\\n\\n\\\n  B.

These 3 tags would indicate that the actual threshold rule is a rule that applies to the US, calculates Overtime, and has a threshold of 8.

These categories are used to trigger validations and rules on time entries, for summary timecard analytics, or for balances used in rules.   A time category itself can be a nested time category of other time categories.   In Fusion, the attributes available for compiling a time category will be time attribute fields or other time categories. <p>\\n                   <p>The time category definition requires the flexibility for a user to add as many conditions as they need to summarize time attributes.  It is also required to group these conditions into logical expressions, with comparisons between these expressions.  In order to offer this flexibility, we will use the Fusion Structured Condition Builder Guideline.  Reference to this Guideline: http://fusiongps.us.oracle.com/guidelines/content/guidelines/expressionbuilder/conditions/index.htm#StructuredCondition. Using this structured condition builder design approach will make it easier for users to uptake the feature, as they will have exposure to this design in other applications, such as AMX approval rules setup.<p>\\n                   <p>Create Time Category page</p>\\n\\n\\\n  <p>Create Time Category : Page Name</p>\\n\\n\\\n  <p>Tags: enable the web center icon to allow user to define tags on time categories</p>\\n\\n         <p>Summary Information:</p>\\n\\\n  <p>\\n   <li> Name: Time Category Name</li>\\n\\n <li>   Description: Time Category Description</li>\\n\\\n  </p>\\n    <p>     Time Category Condition Pane</p>\\n\\n    <p> Actions Menu</p>\\n    <p>\\n          <li> Add</li>\\n          <li> Duplicate</li>\\n            \\n          <li>Delete</li>\\n            \\n          <li>Add Nest</li>\\n          <li> Delete Nest </li>\\n\\\n  </p>\\n\\\n  <p>Actions Behavior</p>\\n\\\n  <p>\\n\\\n  <li>  Add New Row (No Selection): A new row is inserted after the last row in the table.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li>    Add New Row (Row Selected): A new row is added below the selected row.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li> Add New Row (Multiple Rows Selected): One new row is added below the last selected row.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li>    Duplicate Row: The duplicate row is added below the selected row.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li> Duplicate Multiple Rows: The group of duplicated rows is added below the selected group.</li>\\n\\n\\\n  <li>    Duplicate Noncontiguous Duplication: The group of duplicated rows is added below the selected row or group of rows.\\n\\\n  Example: If the user selects rows 2, 3, and 5, and then clicks the Duplicate icon, the duplicated rows appear below the 2 and 3 grouping and below row 5. \\n\\\n  </li>\\n\\\n  <li>    Delete Row: Deletes the selected row from the table.

For example, a timecard period may have aduration of biweekly, but an approval period defined for payroll might be weekly.  The ability for different time consumers to define different approval periods for the timecards to be retrieved allows for the time to be transferred on a timely basis to the time consumer.  Approval periods will be setup in the time consumer set UI, associated to each time consumer who will be retrieving the worker\\xE2\\x80\\x99s timecard data.\\n\\n\\\n  Approval periods can span across timecards.  For example, an approval period for Payroll might be weekly, which could start on one timecard and complete on the next timecard.  In this example, when the 2nd timecard has reached the approval period upon submit, the time from the prior timecard needs to be consolidated with the time from the 2nd timecard and routed for approval.  In this example, it is important to note that the submission of the first timecard would not trigger approval, it was upon the submitting of the 2nd timecard that it needed to be determined if the overlapping approval period was met.\\n\\n\\\n  Some examples of when timecard periods and approval periods are not aligned:\\n\\n\\\n  In some cases customers want to have a short Timecard Period and a long Approval Period. This is because the customer wants to force users to submit time on a frequent basis yet not burden their approvers with frequent approvals.  \\n\\\n  For example: Daily Timecard Period and Weekly Approval Period   \\n\\n\\\n  In some cases customers (eg Santos) want to have a short approval period and a longer timecard period. This is because the customer wants to move the time that\\xE2\\x80\\x99s been entered through to the time consumer as quickly as possible. For example, a weekly timecard period and a daily approval period. Users submit there timecard whenever they enter time and this time is then sent to the approver and can be transferred to the time consumer without waiting till the end of the week.\\n\\n\\\n  In the case where there is more than one time consumer for a given worker\'s time, it may be that 2 or more of the Time Consumers have their own, \'natural\' approval period. For example Projects might have a Weekly Expenditure Period and Payroll a Bi-monthly payroll period. In this case, at least one of the approval periods must differ from the Timecard Period.\"\niteration_id: \n','2011-04-13 22:37:29'),(3197,'Feature',1013,'destroy','1','--- \nscope: \nname: Approval Rules (AMX)\ncreated_at: 2011-04-13 22:37:05 Z\nupdated_at: 2011-04-13 22:37:05 Z\npriority: \nid: 1013\nfunctional_work_unit_id: 110\ndescription: \"In order to correctly route the timecard data to approvers, there are evaluations of the timecard that need to be done which would continue the same functionality as Approval Styles and Approval Rules in EBS Time and Labor R12.

We are calling this process \\xE2\\x80\\x9CForced Transfer\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.  Going forward with this solution, that will permit the timecard to carry on its normal approval route and hence allows the approver to reject the timecards if wrong/missing entries were made. If the timecard gets rejected, after getting transfered in a time consumer application, after the timecard gets corrected and approved, in the next transfer to the time consumer adjustement will be made.\\n\\n\\\n  An alternate solution for terminated workers is that we can subscribe to event triggers such as terminations of employees, which would trigger the adjustment of approval periods to end on the employee\\xE2\\x80\\x99s termination date, to expedite the approval of the required timecards.\"\niteration_id: \n','2011-04-13 22:37:29'),(3202,'Feature',1018,'destroy','1','--- \nscope: \nname: Approval of Blank Timecards (AMX)\ncreated_at: 2011-04-13 22:37:05 Z\nupdated_at: 2011-04-13 22:37:05 Z\npriority: \nid: 1018\nfunctional_work_unit_id: 110\ndescription: \"For businesses which always require timecards to be generated and approved for all time periods for their employees, it is important that even a blank timecard can be approved.

A set of  related values may\\n be entered often by the user, so it would be helpful to allow the\\n user to string them together with a shortcut or combination code.\\n  For the business, there may be a set of related attribute values\\n which are valid for the worker entry.  \\n      In this scenario, the administrator could setup a list of the related\\n attribute values which are relevant for the user and associate them\\n to a shortcut or combination code.

Additionally, the related attributes may be display\\n only or may be editable by the user.

In future use of the \\\"combination code\\\"\\n field, all the values that the user entered would be available for\\n his entry.  Once he selected a combination code, the other related\\n time attributes would automatically be populated.  There would need\\n to be some business rules set in place for the saved combination\\n codes, that they were unique, for the set of values being entered.\\n\\\n  o\\tDynamic Alternate Name Set - Enhance the Alternate Name Set so that\\n an administrator can enter a simple code when setting up the Alternate\\n Name values, which can be associated to a set of time attribute values,\\n which can be displayed or not displayed on the timecard matrix. \\n In the Timecard, the Combination Code can be displayed as the \\\"editable\\\"\\n field for entry, using the alternate name set as the choice list,\\n and the related fields would be displayed or not, as per the setup\\n of the Alternate Name.\\n\\\n  There may be a long list of related values which require combination\\n codes to be associated to them.  In this case, there might need to\\n be a batch process to auto-generate unique combination codes for\\n a long list of combinations of values.  There will also need to be\\n a validation process to ensure each value in the combinations is\\n still valid for use.  \\n\\\n  o\\tMost Frequently Used - Allow for user configuration of time attributes\\n to link together to reference for \\\"most frequently used\\\" values.\\n  The display of these values can be auto-generated by the system\\n based on previous usage.  This combination of values can be accessed\\n by the user to apply to new rows of data.\\n\\\n  o\\t\\\"My Favorites\\\" - Values - Allow for user configuration of time attributes\\n to link together for reference for favorites.

Contextual Area Option\\n\\n\\\n  Open Calendar Navigation\\n\\\n  The idea is to always have an opened calendar display for the user,\\n to highlight the current timecard period which is currently displayed,\\n and be allowed to select the next or previous timecard period by\\n clicking on any date in the calendar month displayed.

At this point we are\\n not offering a switcher for less than a  week. \\n\\n\\\n  Prior to Fusion, the timecard user would have a horizontal scroll\\n to navigate through the timecard  days.  The  following are two options\\n the user can choose from in the Time Entry Page Composer. \\n\\n\\\n  The display of a timecard period will always start with the start\\n date of the timecard instance.\\n\\n\\\n  A.  Weekly Selector\\n\\n\\\n  Allows for a user to easily navigate from one week to another for\\n timecard periods which exceed one week.  This option  would allow\\n the user to not have to scroll horizontally through weeks, but be\\n able to click an arrow to the next week or  prior week within the\\n timecard.  This would be most beneficial for bi-weekly timecard users.\\n\\n\\\n  For semi-monthly or monthly timecard periods, there may be days not\\n applicable at the end of the week which are not part of the current\\n period, which would be grayed out. There would be a week selector\\n above the timecard matrix for the user to navigate back and forth\\n between the weeks within the timecard period.

As a result, the attributes\\n from one week would display on the other weeks, since only the days\\n are being scrolled to the right.\\n\\\n  Open Design Issue:  An issue with this design is the error messaging\\n reference to the correct location of the error.  If the user is accessing\\n the error message listing pop-up (listed above in Must Have Section\\n 2.3.1), and clicks on the error message, the cursor should take the\\n user to where the error exists in the timecard matrix.  With the\\n intra-period navigation, not all entries are visible at once, so\\n this functionality would not work.  A recommendation from UX is that\\n when the user is accessing errors from the error message listing\\n pop-up the intra-period navigation is hidden and the user will get\\n the normal horizontal scroll through the days.\\n\\n\\\n  B.  Horizontal Scroll with Column Grouping by Week\\n\\n\\\n  This design is an alternate design option to allow for horizontal\\n scroll through the timecard period.  Both options will be available\\n in the timecard layout set creation. The attributes would not scroll,\\n only the days of the week.
