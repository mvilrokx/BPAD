WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE INTERFACE TO AGILEFANT KICKS OFF
======================================================

Business Process
================

BPAD      Agilefant
----      ---------
New    -> New Project Backlog gets created under a Product
Update -> Name will get updated, overriding these values in Agilefant (BPAD =
          source of thruth)!
Delete -> ? If anything, we need to warn people this is already in Agilefant and
          will impact it.  In fact I think we should prevent any deletion in
          BPAD if it exists in Agilefant cause the ramifications would be pretty
          significant, wipping out everything in Agilefant.


Paths
=====

BPAD      Agilefant
----      ---------
New    -> New Story gets created in the Business Process' Product Backlog
Update -> Name, Description will get updated overriding these values in
          Agilefant (BPAD = Source of Thruth)!
Delete -> ? If anything, we need to warn people this is already in Agilefant and
          will impact it.  In fact I think we should prevent any deletion in
          BPAD if it exists in Agilefant cause the ramifications would be pretty
          significant, wipping out everything in Agilefant.


Mapped Build Features
=====================

BPAD      Agilefant
----      ---------
Map    -> New Story gets created under the Path's Story
Update -> Name, Description will get updated overriding these values in
          Agilefant (BPAD = Source of Thruth)!
Move   -> Move Story to different Path's Story
Unmap  -> If the Story has not been "used" yet, it could get deleted.
          "used" in this case means if it has any tasks associated to it.
          If it has tasks, we would move them to the Product Backlog.  This will
          preserve them and all their data and we can put them back under a
          Story if they get re-mapped (see below)
Re-map -> Move from Product Backlog to Story in Project Backlog
Delete -> ? If anything, we need to warn people this is already in Agilefant and
          will impact it.
